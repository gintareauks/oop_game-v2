# oop_game-v2
Techdegree Full Stack JS Project 4

FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
Some changes to make my project look a little bit more unique. 
1. Changed the main font, to make the game look more mystical. 
2. Added Transition to the letter card. When the correct letter displays, the card with the letter flips/rotates by 360 deg.
